- ✅ Use direct image links (ending in .jpg, .png, .gif)
- ✅ Make sure the image is publicly accessible
- ✅ Square images work best (1:1 aspect ratio)
- ✅ Recommended size: 400x400 pixels or larger

## Testing Your URL:

Before saving, paste your URL in a new browser tab to make sure it shows your image correctly.

## Troubleshooting:

**Image not showing?**
- Make sure the URL starts with `https://`
- Check if the image is publicly accessible
- Try opening the URL in an incognito/private browser window
- Some URLs expire - use a permanent hosting service

**Image too large/small?**
- The app will automatically resize it
- But for best quality, use 400x400 to 800x800 pixels

**Privacy concerns?**
- Only use images you're comfortable sharing
- You can create a separate profile picture for this app
- Consider using Gravatar for better privacy control
